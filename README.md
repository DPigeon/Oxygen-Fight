A variation of Balloon Fight: a 2D game made with Unity.

### Compile & Run

The game can be compiled while editing and saving a C# file and running the MainMenu scene. It can then be run by pressing the Play
button on Unity scene.

### Play

You can play the game by pressing the Play button on the Unity window of the MainMenu scene file. Then, the player chooses between
2 modes: Normal Mode and Special Mode. In both modes, the goal is to get as many points as possible by collecting golden items and
bringing them to the boat. Two lives are generated after each completion of a level and a special sound is made after leveling up. 
You may use button "Z" to swim upward by tapping it and use left, right and down arrows to move in other directions. The special 
mode allows you to obtain a golden nitro tank. Its power is that it will make you swim very fast in all direction for 3 seconds.
